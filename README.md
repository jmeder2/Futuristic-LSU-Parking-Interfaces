# LSU Futuristic Parking Interfaces

**First of all, I would like to also credit my former teammates for this project: Phu Nguyen and Jacob Marzloff.**

This was a team project for a class called Interface Design Technology, a 4th year Undergraduate Computer Science course. In the class, we learned about emerging technologies and applied our knowledge of user interface design to create beautiful, interactive interfaces that are fun and engaging (as well as a lot of other non-functional requirements!)

If you were to try this code, you may or may not be able to depending on the equipment you have.

This project used a total of 8 screens, which consisted of:
* 27" Multitouch Screen (Microsoft Surface Pro 2)
* 2x1 tiled display, the top screen a 4K resolution, the bottom screen a 2K resolution
* 2x2 tiled display, each of the screen are equally sized as standard 1920x1200 resolution
* An iPhone with TouchOSC installed ($5 app with programmable OSC Messaging)
    - **NOTE:** About TouchOSC, see here http://hexler.net/software/touchosc

**Next, you can see our old instructions we gave to our professor to run the project below**

##### Old Instructions

```
Place the whole project directory on each the following machines:

27" multitouch
2x2 tiled display
2x1 tiled display

(Or use TortoiseSVN to clone the files onto these machines.)

Then do as instructed in command line:

On 27" multitouch: java TouchScreen

On 2x2 display: java TiledDisplay

On 2x1 display: java ParkingScreen


Additionally: Use TouchOSC on iPhone for 2x1 display.

If connections between the machines fail, be sure to check the ip addresses and adjust TouchScreen.java accordingly. TouchScreen.java handles ALL the sending message functions.
```
